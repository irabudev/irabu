## Registration

1.  Each registration of any domain commits the client irrevocably.

## Responsibility

1.  Since the award of the domain names on the internet depends on the express approval of the competent authority, Irabu is at no time responsible for any refusal. Also damages compensation do not exist.

## Duration of the agreement

1.  The registration of a domain name is always for a period of 1 year, unless otherwise agreed. Except for written notice, the domain name will at expiry automatically be extended for a period of 1 year.

## Modalities

1.  The client takes note of the fact that Irabu acts only as an intermediary between the client and the authority that assigns the domain name. Applying and maintaining the domain name needs is simply and only to be considered as an additional client service.

Irabu will in no way be held liable if the client loses control of the domain name as a result of such regulations or any other reason. Irabu will for that matter always seek to defend the interests of the client.
